Demonstrating how to get the data and clean it and the dataset used in this particular course is from[UCI ML Repo](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[Source Data Location.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Important Information

Please do check the location of your data and the code location and make the necessary changes to directory using setwd

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
